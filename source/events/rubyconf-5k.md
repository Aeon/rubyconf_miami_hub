It's back again! RubyConf 2013 will feature a 5k run to get that blood flowing
before an awesome day of talks. Join us on the boardwalk outside of the hotel
pool area no later than 7:45 am on Saturday (11/9) for an 8am race start.
Everyone is welcome, from 5k speedsters to morning beach-walkers.

The course will go north from the hotel along the beach/boardwalk. It will be an
out-and-back style course (meaning you'll run 2.5k north and then come back).
The race will be timed.
