Ruby On Sails is an event not worth missing. You and your friends can come join
us the day before the RubyConf kickoff and spend a morning chartering a
sailboat on Biscayne Bay. Our priority is to get individuals with technical
passion for Ruby together for an experience you won’t soon forget. We have
everything arranged, now we just need you. We’re taking multiple boats out for
a day of non-stop awesome fun. We'll have the kickoff event to start your
conference off right. Our sponsors below have covered most of the cost. We'll
ask a modest $20 per person to cover the after cookout, so grab your sunscreen,
your bathing suits, and your friends, and lets do this. Registration is open
now. We can't wait to see you this November!
