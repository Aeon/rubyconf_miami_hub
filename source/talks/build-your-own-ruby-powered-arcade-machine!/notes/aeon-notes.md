- level 1, building the machine
	- cabinet - standup, cockpit, coctail table, bar-top arcade... 
	- control panel layout
		- one player, two, more?
		- all kinds of different buttons...
		- switches? micro, micro-leaf, true leaf.
		- joysticks - 4-way or 8-way... use restrictor plates - there's a bunch of different kinds...
		- tons of extras - trackballs, flight sticks, light guns, steering wheels.
		- slagcoin.com has layouts based on most popular controllers, good for reference
	- keyboard encoder
		- ultimarc.com, i-pac is very popular, supports 2 players
	- computer
		- reuse any old machine, since the arcades don't really need much power.
		- but hardware needs to support your needs... and able to be kiosk friendly, without weird dongles for video output or stuff like that.
		- Raspberry pi has composite video built in... aha!
	- Construction
		- use your awesome carpentry skills to build the best cabinet in the world.
		- used "textured contact paper" for the surface
		- plexiglass is great, but more expensive...
- level 2 - Front-end / game launcher
	- Build our own... 
		- started with curses, cmd-line only
		- tried shoes, but it's not easy to make it work for full-screen apps and keyboard/controller input 
		- didn't like QT
		- settled on Gosu - crossplatform, openGL/C++, ruby wrapper
	- Gosu provides hardware abstraction, run loop, handles input, provides API for shapes, images, text
	- ruby game engines
		- Gosu - desktop
		- RubyMotion - Joybox - iOS
		- JRuby - LibGDX, Slick2D - desktop, android
	- Gosu libraries:
		- Gamebox
		- Chingu
		- Metro
	- Physics Engine:
		- Chipmunk

- aside...
	- how to run gosu on raspberry pi?
	- Raspbian now comes with python, pygame... 
		- so kids are learning python instead of ruby! oh noes!
	- we need to improve gosu so it can run on raspberry pi!
		- need help replacing Gosu custom c++ code to use SDL instead - that will allow for much easier porting/maintainability
	- get involved in teaching kids Ruby and game programming
		- GameEducationPDX.com, KidsRuby
	- change perceptions
		- computer science does not mean you'll be spending your life working on Excel
	- improve ruby
		- rubygamedev.com
		- ruby is not seen as a good platform for game programming... but it could be!
- level 3 - game programming
	- games are big business.
	- avg. ios indie game - 86K/year revenue (source?)
	- all the gaming platforms run c/c++
	- there's a ton of c++ gaming libraries...
	- but we have mruby!
	- which means we can leverage the existing C/C++ game libs and write just the controlling code in ruby...
