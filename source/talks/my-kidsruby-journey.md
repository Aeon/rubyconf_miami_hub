Katie is a coder, dancer, writer, 6th grader who loves to code and wants to learn everything there is to know.

## Talk Abstract
About a year ago, we started a journey to see if kids can code. Guess what?

They can!!

This talk will be a review of the journey itself and a discussion between parent
and child on what happened, what's next, and what you should be doing to
encourage the next generation of developers.
