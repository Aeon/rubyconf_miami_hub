## Talk Abstract

Just as Ruby is great for getting a new web project off the ground and into production, Ruby is equally awesome for quickly building games up from scratch and continuing to iterate on them. This talk explores the basics of how computer games work, shows the tools available for building games in Ruby, and has a live demonstration of creating a simple game.
