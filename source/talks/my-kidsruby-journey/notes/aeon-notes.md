KidsRuby Journey - PJ & Katie Hagerty

- Katie started to code in 4th grade, initially to beat her older brother at it
- now wants to code for fun
- "I wanted to be like my dad and be a ruby programmer and work at home in my pajamas"
- started with kidsruby.com 
- kids learn fast... people forget how smart they can be after they grow up
- cutest keynote talk ever
- "do you want to be a bazzilionaire?"
	- "well, I do, but forget about the money, it's about helping people"
- "what do you say to kids who want to learn to program?"
	- "do it, it's fun"
- "what do you say to adults who want to help kids learn how to program?"
	- "Don't say "[Kids], here's a laptop and candy, come code with us!"... anyway, you can't make them learn, it's for people who find it interesting".
- resources for kids: 
	- coder dojos, 
	- kidsruby.com, 
	- hackety.com, 
	- codeacademy
- Doing more stuff than just tutorials? 
	- Working on a project with her dad - kitter, like twitter for kids. 
	- Also building an app for her coder dojo.
