## Talk Abstract

These days a full system is comprised off many different applications and services. These services need to communicate with each other in a common and decoupled way.

Many applications can be simplified by communicating seamlessly and asynchronously across a common message bus.

Interacting with services written in the same, or a different, language is simplified since the message bus becomes the central highway of messaging.

We'll explore life on the message bus, it's history, implementation, and use. All aboard.
