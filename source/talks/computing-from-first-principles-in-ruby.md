## About the speaker

I run Jumpstart Lab and have spoken at many conferences including RubyConf, RailsConf, GoRuCo, GoGaRuCo, Rocky Mountain Ruby, RubyNation, and RubyConf Argentina.

## Talk Abstract

Writing good Ruby is all about creating abstractions. But there are amazing abstractions right beneath your fingertips: electrical signals abstracted into binary numbers into logic gates into flip-flops, registers, ALUs, on up.

Let's bring the world of low-level hardware into object-oriented Ruby and explore:

* Building foundational logic gates in Ruby to mimic the hardware 
* Using those gates to construct flip-flops and multiplexers 
* Using those components to create memory and adders 
* Then building fundamental components like ALUs and CPUs 
* Implementing fundamental instructions (like the 8088 set) 
* Using those instructions to implement algorithms 
* Visualizing the whole execution path while instructions are clocked through the system

High-level languages offer us the privilege of ignoring the hardware. But developing a deeper understanding of how the machine is constructed can influence how we design and abstract complex systems.
