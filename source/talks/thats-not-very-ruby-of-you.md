## About the Speaker

Ernie's been writing code since he was 6 years old, but only getting paid to do so for the past 15 years or so. Sometimes he still can't believe people actually *pay us* to have this much fun.

He's the author of a bunch of Rubygems, some of which might even be useful, a contributor to Rails, a committer to Arel, and an ardent believer that all true first person shooters are played with a mouse and keyboard.

## Talk Abstract

How Ruby is your Ruby? As we've found our way to Ruby, we've all brought with us habits and idioms from the languages we know and love (or hate). Sometimes, these habits serve us well, and other times, they make our lives more difficult. More often, they make life difficult for our collaborators, who don't expect to see C, Java, or PHP in their Ruby codebase.

Not only that, as many new Rubyists have found their way to Ruby from Rails, they've brought along various Rails-isms, some of which aren't even a good idea in Rails-land (callbacks, anyone?), or dependencies on libraries like ActiveSupport which are overkill for their real needs.

We'll talk about some of the baggage we bring to our Ruby code, and some simple techniques that will help us leave it behind.
