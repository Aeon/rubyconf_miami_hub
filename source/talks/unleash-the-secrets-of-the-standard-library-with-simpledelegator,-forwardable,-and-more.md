## Talk Abstract

With Ruby you have simple tools at your fingertips that make building powerful tools easy. Ruby's standard library comes with some helpful libraries like 'delegate' and 'forwardable' that will help make your code easier to maintain.

We'll dive into how SimpleDelegator is different from method_missing and how Forwardable differs still. Learn the basis of the ideas behind these and combine the features to build your own powerful patterns. See how these compare to libraries like ActiveSupport::Delegation and look at how popular presenter libraries like Draper and DisplayCase work.
